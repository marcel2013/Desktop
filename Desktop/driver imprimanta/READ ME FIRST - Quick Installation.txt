*******************************************************************************


For best results, DO NOT CONNECT YOUR PRINTER until after driver has been 
installed or when the installation tells you to do so.

Extra the files if they are in a ZIP file to a suitable location, 
e.g. C:\Drivers or to your Windows Desktop.   Installing directly from the ZIP
file can cause issues on some systems.

To begin the installation, double-click on DriverInstall.CMD (or just DriverInstall)
and the driver will start.


For Windows 10 users, after installation, you should select the ICM(I) 
colour adjustment to give the most natural colour reproduction:-

- Right-click on the printer and choose "Printing Preferences"
- Click on the Option tab
- Choose ICM(I) from the Color Adjustment section
- Click Apply/OK to save.


A detailed driver instruction manual for Windows installation is included as a PDF.
